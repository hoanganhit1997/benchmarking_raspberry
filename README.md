# Benchmarking a TensorFlow model on the Raspberry Pi
This repository contains code for check speed of a Tensorflow model on Raspberrry Pi. The model used for testing is SSD Mobilenet v2. I use pre-train model from tensorflow model zoo. You can download file . tflife from here (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5D6Pw05JlhlxCJXgD021CYHPAtpYGJY/view?usp=sharing). The source code I use is referenced from here (https://blog.hackster.io/benchmarking-tensorflow-and-tensorflow-lite-on-the-raspberry-pi-43f51b796796)
