# Benchmarking a TensorFlow model on the Raspberry Pi
This repository contains code for check speed of a Tensorflow model on Raspberrry Pi. The model used for testing is SSD Mobilenet v2. I use pre-train model from here (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md). The source code I use is referenced from here (https://blog.hackster.io/benchmarking-tensorflow-and-tensorflow-lite-on-the-raspberry-pi-43f51b796796)
